# Crystal 程式語言

這裡是 Crystal 語言的教學文件，由 [Crystal-TW](http://crystal-tw.github.io) 翻譯，原文連接[在此](http://crystal-lang.org/docs)。

Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:

* Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
* Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
* Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
* Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
* Compile to efficient native code.
