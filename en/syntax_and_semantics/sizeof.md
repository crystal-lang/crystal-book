# sizeof

The `sizeof` expression returns an `Int32` with the size in bytes of a given type. For example:

```crystal
sizeof(Int32)  #=> 4
sizeof(Int64)  #=> 8
```

For [Reference](http://crystal-lang.org/api/Reference.html) types, the size is the same as the size of a pointer:

```crystal
# On a 64 bits machine
sizeof(Pointer(Int32)) #=> 8
sizeof(String)         #=> 8
```

This is because a Reference's memory is allocated on the heap and a pointer to it is passed around. To get the effective size of a class, use [instance_sizeof](instance_sizeof.html).

The argument to sizeof is a [type](type_grammar.html) and is often combined with [typeof](typeof.html):

```crystal
a = 1
sizeof(typeof(a)) #=> 4
```
