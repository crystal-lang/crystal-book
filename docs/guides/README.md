# Guides
This guide, is the most current up to date reference on the Crystal Programming Language. However in 2024, we are expecting massive changes to take place as far as updating the documentation goes. We welcome all people who want to contribute, big and small for example just fixing a typo in the documentation is something that can help tremendously.
