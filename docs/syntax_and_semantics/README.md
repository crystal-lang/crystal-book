# About this guide

This is a formal specification of the Crystal language.

You can read this document from top to bottom, but it’s advisable to jump through sections because some concepts are interrelated and can’t be explained in isolation.

The [Language Introduction tutorial](../tutorials/basics/README.md) offers a more focused learning experience for beginners.
