# Comments

Comments start with the `#` character. All following content up to the end of
the line is part of the comment. Comments may be on their own line or follow
after a Crystal expression (trailing comment).

```crystal
# This is a comment
puts "hello" # This is a trailing comment
```

The purpose of comments is documenting the code. Public documentation, including
autogenerated API docs, is a special feature based on comments and is described
in [*Documenting Code*](../conventions/documenting_code.html).
