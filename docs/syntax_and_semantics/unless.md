# unless

An `unless` evaluates the then branch if its condition is *falsey*, and evaluates the `else branch`, if thereâ€™s any, otherwise. That is, it behaves in the opposite way of an `if`:

```crystal
unless some_condition
  then_expression
else
  else_expression
end

# The above is the same as:
if some_condition
  else_expression
else
  then_expression
end

# Can also be written as a suffix
close_door unless door_closed?
```
