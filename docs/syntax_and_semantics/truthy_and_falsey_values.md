# Truthy and falsey values

A *truthy* value is a value that is considered true for an `if`, `unless`, `while` or `until` guard. A *falsey* value is a value that is considered false in those places.

The only falsey values are `nil`, `false` and null pointers (pointers whose memory address is zero). Any other value is truthy.
