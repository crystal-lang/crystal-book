# Methods

To avoid duplication of the same message, instead of using a variable we can
define a method and call it multiple times.

A method definition is indicated by the keyword `def` followed by the method name.
Every expression until the keyword `end` is part of the method body.

```crystal-play
def say_hello
  puts "Hello Penny!"
end

say_hello
say_hello
say_hello() # syntactically equivalent method call with parentheses
```

!!! tip
    Method calls are unambiguously indicated by parentheses after the name, but they can be omitted. It would only be
    necessary for disambiguation, for example, if `say_hello` was also a local variable.

## Arguments

What if we want to greet different people, but all in the same manner?
Instead of writing individual messages, we can define a method that allows customization through a parameter.
A parameter is like a local variable inside the method body. Parameters are declared after the method name in parentheses.
When calling a method, you can pass in arguments that are mapped as values for the method's parameters.

```crystal-play
def say_hello(recipient)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello "Crystal"
```

!!! tip
    Arguments at method calls are typically placed in parentheses, but it can often be omitted. `say_hello "World"`
    and `say_hello("World")` are syntactically equivalent.

    It's generally recommended to use parentheses because it avoids ambiguity. But they're often omitted if the
    expression reads like natural language.

### Default arguments

Arguments can be assigned a default value. It is used in case the argument is missing in the method call. Usually,
arguments are mandatory but when there's a default value, it can be omitted.

```crystal-play
def say_hello(recipient = "World")
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello
say_hello "Crystal"
```

## Type Restrictions

Our example method expects `recipient` to be a `String`. But any other type would work as well. Try `say_hello 6`
for example.

This isn't necessarily a problem for this method. Using any other type would be valid code.
But semantically we want to greet people with a name as a `String`.

Type restrictions limit the allowed type of an argument. They come after the argument name, separated by a colon:

```crystal-play
def say_hello(recipient : String)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello "Crystal"

# Now this expression doesn't compile:
# say_hello 6
```

Now names cannot be numbers or other data types anymore. This doesn't mean you can't
greet people with a number as a name. The number just needs to be expressed as a string.
Try `say_hello "6"` for example.

## Overloading

Restricting the type of an argument can be used for positional overloading.
When a method has an unrestricted argument like `say_hello(recipient)`, *all* calls to a method `say_hello` go to that method.
But with overloading several methods of the same name can exist with different argument type restrictions. Each call is routed
to the most fitting overload.

```crystal-play
# This methods greets *recipient*.
def say_hello(recipient : String)
  puts "Hello #{recipient}!"
end

# This method greets *times* times.
def say_hello(times : Int32)
  puts "Hello " * times
end

say_hello "World"
say_hello 3
```

Overloading isn't defined just by type restrictions. The number of arguments as well as named arguments are also
relevant characteristics.
