# On OpenSUSE

In OpenSUSE, you can use the official Crystal repository.

## Setup repository

First you have to add the signing key:

```
rpm --import https://dist.crystal-lang.org/rpm/RPM-GPG-KEY
```

Next you have to configure the repository in Zypper. You can do this with the following command:

```
sudo zypper ar -e -f -t rpm-md https://dist.crystal-lang.org/rpm/ Crystal```
```

## Install
Once the repository is configured you're ready to install Crystal:

```
sudo zypper install crystal
```

## Upgrade

When a new Crystal version is released you can upgrade your system using:

```
sudo zypper update crystal
```
