# Database

To access a relational database you will need a shard designed for the database server you want to use. The package [crystal-lang/crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db) offers a unified api across different drivers.

The following packages are compliant with crystal-db

* [crystal-lang/crystal-sqlite3](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-sqlite3) for sqlite
* [crystal-lang/crystal-mysql](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-mysql) for mysql & mariadb
* [will/crystal-pg](https://github.com/will/crystal-pg) for postgres

This guide presents the api of crystal-db, the sql commands might need to be adapted for the concrete driver due to differences between postgres, mysql and sqlite.

Also some drivers may offer additional functionality like postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`.

## Installing the shard

Choose the appropriate driver from the list above and add it as any shard to your application's `shard.yml`

There is no need to explicitly require `crystal-lang/crystal-db`

During this guide `crystal-lang/crystal-mysql` will be used.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mysql:
    github: crystal-lang/crystal-mysql
```

## Open database

`DB.open` will allow you to easily connect to a database using a connection uri. The schema of the uri determines the expected driver. The following sample connects to a local mysql database named test with user root and password blank.

```crystal
require "db"
require "mysql"

DB.open "mysql://root@localhost/test" do |db|
  # ... use db to perform queries
end
```

Other connection uris are

* `sqlite3:///path/to/data.db`
* `mysql://user:password@server:port/database`
* `postgres://server:port/database`

Alternatively you can use a non yielding `DB.open` method as long as `Database#close` is called at the end.

```crystal
require "db"
require "mysql"

db = DB.open "mysql://root@localhost/test"
begin
  # ... use db to perform queries
ensure
  db.close
end
```

## Exec

To execute sql statements you can use `Database#exec`

```crystal
db.exec "create table contacts (name varchar(30), age int)"
```

To avoid sql injection use parameters to submit data

```crystal
db.exec "insert into contacts values (?, ?)", "John", 30
db.exec "insert into contacts values (?, ?)", "Sarah", 33
```

Note: When using the pg driver, use `$1`, `$2`, etc. instead of `?`

## Query

To perform a query and get the result set use `Database#query`, arguments can be used as in `Database#exec`.

`Database#query` returns a `ResultSet` that needs to be closed. As in `Database#open`, if called with a block, the `ResultSet` will be closed implicitly.

```crystal
db.query "select name, age from contacts order by age desc" do |rs|
  rs.each do
    # ... perform for each row in the ResultSet
  end
end
```

When reading values from the database there is no type information during compile time that crystal can use. You will need to call `rs.read(T)` with the type `T` you expect to get from the database.

```crystal
db.query "select name, age from contacts order by age desc" do |rs|
  rs.each do
    name = rs.read(String)
    age = rs.read(Int32)
    puts "#{name} (#{age})"
    # => Sarah (33)
    # => John Doe (30)
  end
end
```

There are many convenient query methods built on top of `#query`.

You can read multiple columns at once:

```crystal
name, age = rs.read(String, Int32)
```

Or read a single row:

```crystal
name, age = db.query_one "select name, age from contacts order by age desc limit 1", as: { String, Int32 }
```

Or read a scalar value without dealing explicitly with the ResultSet:

```crystal
max_age = db.scalar "select max(age) from contacts"
```

All available methods to perform statements in a database are defined in `DB::QueryMethods`.
