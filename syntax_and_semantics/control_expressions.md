# Control expressions

Before exploring control expressions, you may want to learn about Crystal's [truthy and falsey values](truthy_and_falsey_values.html).

Crystal has a variety of ways to control execution. The following control expressions are available:

* [if / else / elsif](if_else_elsif.html)
* [unless](unless.html)
* [case](case.html)
* [while](while.html)
    - [break](break.html)
    - [next](next.html)
* [&& (and)](and.html)
* [|| (or)](or.html)
