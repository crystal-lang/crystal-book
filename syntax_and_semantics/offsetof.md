# offsetof

An `offsetof` expression returns the byte offset of an instance variable in a struct or class type. It accepts the type as first argument and the instance variable name prefixed by an `@` as second argument:

```cr
offsetof(Type, @ivar)
```

This is a low-level primitive and only useful if a C API needs to directly interface with the data layout of a Crystal type.

Example:
```cr
struct Foo
  @x = 0_i64
  @y = 34_i32
end

offsetof(Foo, @y) # => 8
```
