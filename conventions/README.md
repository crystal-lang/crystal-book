# Conventions

Follow these conventions so your code will be more accessible to other developers.

* Use [standard coding style](coding_style.md) so your project will be navigable and readable to others.
* Write [documentation](documenting_code.md) to express the purpose of your code and support the `crystal docs` generator.
